# Vercel Environment Variables (automatically set by Vercel)
# No manual configuration needed - these are set automatically:

# VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_ID - Unique ID for each deployment
# VERCEL_ENV - Environment (production/preview/development)
# VERCEL_REGION - Region where function runs

# For local development, these won't be set and you'll see "development" values
